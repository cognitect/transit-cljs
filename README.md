# transit-cljs

Transit is a data format and a set of libraries for conveying values between
applications written in different languages. This library provides support for
marshalling Transit data to/from ClojureScript. Unlike the Java and Clojure
implementations it relies on the non-streaming JSON parsing mechanism of the
host JavaScript environment.

* [Rationale](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit)
* [API docs](http://cognitect.github.io/transit-cljs/)
* [Specification](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)
* [Getting Started](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-cljs/wiki/Getting-Started)

This implementation's major.minor version number corresponds to the version of
the Transit specification it supports.

_NOTE: Transit is intended primarily as a wire protocol for transferring data between applications. If storing Transit data durably, readers and writers are expected to use the same version of Transit and you are responsible for migrating/transforming/re-storing that data when and if the transit format changes._ 

## Releases and Dependency Information

* Latest release: 0.8.256

### Leiningen

Add the following to your `project.clj` `:dependencies`:

```
[com.cognitect/transit-cljs "0.8.256"]
```

### Maven

[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) dependency information:

```xml

## Usage

```clojure
(ns example
  (:require [cognitect.transit :as t]))

(defn roundtrip [x]
  (let [w (t/writer :json)
        r (t/reader :json)]
    (t/read r (t/write w x))))

(defn test-roundtrip []
  (let [list1 [:red :green :blue]
        list2 [:apple :pear :grape]
        data  {(t/integer 1) list1
               (t/integer 2) list2}
        data' (roundtrip data)]
    (assert (= data data'))))
```

## Default Type Mapping

## Contributing 

This library is open source, developed internally by Cognitect. We welcome
discussions of potential problems and enhancement suggestions on the
[transit-format mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/transit-format). Issues can be
filed using GitHub [issues](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-cljs/issues)
for this project. Because transit is incorporated into products and client
projects, we prefer to do development internally and are not accepting pull
requests or patches.

## Development

### Dependencies

Install dependencies with

```
lein deps
```

### Running the tests & benchmarks

Running the tests:

```
lein cljsbuild once test
```

In order to run the [transit-format](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format) 
`bin/verify` you must first clone transit-format into the same parent directory 
as your transit-cljs checkout and build the roundtrip file:

```
lein cljsbuild once roundtrip
```

To run the benchmarks you must first clone 
[transit-format](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format) into the same
parent directory as your transit-cljs checkout. 

Running the benchmarks:

```
lein cljsbuild once bench
node target/transit.bench.js
```

### Build

#### Build JAR for ClojureScript

Assuming you have a
[JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/downloads/java-ee-sdk-6u3-jdk-7u1-downloads-523391.html)
and [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) installed, the following will
install a JAR suitable for use from ClojureScript into your local
Maven repository.

```
build/package_local
```
