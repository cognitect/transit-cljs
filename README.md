# transit-cljs

Transit is a data format and a set of libraries for conveying values between applications written in different languages. This library provides support for marshalling Transit data to/from ClojureScript.

* [Rationale](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit)
* [API docs](http://cognitect.github.io/transit-cljs/)
* [Specification](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)

This implementation's major.minor version number corresponds to the version of the Transit specification it supports.

_NOTE: Transit is a work in progress and may evolve based on feedback.
As a result, while Transit is a great option for transferring data
between applications, it should not yet be used for storing data
durably over time. This recommendation will change when the
specification is complete._

## Contributing 

This library is open source, developed internally by Cognitect. We welcome discussions of potential problems and enhancement suggestions on the [transit-format mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/transit-format). Issues can be filed using GitHub [issues](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-cljs/issues) for this project. Because transit is incorporated into products and client projects, we prefer to do development internally and are not accepting pull requests or patches.


## Development

### Dependencies

Install dependencies with

```
lein deps
```

### Running the tests & benchmarks

Running the tests:

```
lein cljsbuild once test
open index.html
```

In order to run the `bin/verify` tests you must first build the
roundtrip file:

```
lein cljsbuild once roundtrip
```

Running the benchmarks:

```
lein cljsbuild once bench
node target/transit.bench.js
```
